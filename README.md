Record.py tests the microphone to see if recording .wav is no issue.

Sampling.py records multiple chunks of audio continuously that could be sent to the server as theyâ€™re recorded.

Stitch.py rebuilds the chunks into a longer .wav file, which would be done on the server.

Transcribe.py sends the reconstructed .wav file from the server to google cloud and gets a transcription which is written to a text file.

Vosk works well and is not very compute demanding
